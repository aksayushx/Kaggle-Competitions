# Kaggle-Competitions

This repository holds my submissions in kaggle competitions.

1. **[Real Or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)**

This is a perfect competition to get started with Natural language processing. My model involves use of LSTM units in this task to classify tweets as real or fake based on the style of the text using NLP.

2. **[Bengali.AI Handwritten Grapheme Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19)**

This competition involves classifying handwritten Bengali Graphemes using a CNN. The model got me a score of 0.9316 after about half an hour of training.
